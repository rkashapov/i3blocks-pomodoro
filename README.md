This is a simple Pomodoro app inspired by spt project and is designed to use with i3blocks.
To configure the app just add following lines to your i3blocks config:

```
[pomodoro]
command=/path/to/pomodoro
interval=1
```

A left mouse click on the app block on i3bar toggles pause.
A right mouse click resets timer.
